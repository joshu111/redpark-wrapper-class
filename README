Wrapper around RedPark Serial library to make life easier.

1. Add these files to your projects
    redparkWrapper.h/.m
    RscMgr.h
    redparkSerial.h
    
2. Link Binary With Libraries:
    ExternalAccessory.framework
    Other > libRscMgrUniv.a (in subdirectory /lib within this library)

3. Edit the YOUR_PROJECT-info.plist file
    Add a line for "Supported external accessory protocol"
    Add an item under this new line (left arrow)
    Make the item say "com.redpark.hobdb9" (no quotes)
    
4. Set your class as the <RedparkWrapperDelegate>

5. Implement the delegate methods. 
	-(void) newMessageAvailable:(NSString*)msg
		gets called when a new serial line has been received (line is delimited by \n)

6. Instantiate a redparkWrapper object and set the delegate property to your class
    rp = [[redparkWrapper alloc] init];
    [rp setDelegate:self];
	

6. Send serial data by sending an NSString to [rp sendSerial]

Example:
As a test, you can attach to an arduino running the included sketch and the included xcode project
